I have already visited there many times, but every time I visit still bring me some new and special experiences. There are the shuttle trains and the Maokong Gondola for tourists to take. I always saw many tourists line up for them, so I seldom took them. Last time I went to Taipei Zoo is for a reality game which is in collaboration with Taipei Zoo. I spent the whole day, ran around the Zoo, saw many kinds of animals, and then negotiated the puzzles. Unfortunately, because of the time I have, I did not visit Xinguang Special Exhibit House (Giant Panda House). Not long ago, the panda "TuanTuan" died. I am so sorry to hear that. Last but not least, Taipei Zoo is a great place for a family to go visit, and both parents and children can enjoy themselves.</p></div><div class="experience"><div class="exp-part-one"><h2 class="exp-part-title">Tropical Rainforest Area</h2><img src=Taipei_Zoo11.jpg alt="no pic"><P>Tropical Rainforest Area (Pangolin Dome) displays the species of the tropical rainforest. It looks very magnificent. We go down the bridges that criss-cross in it. When we walked slowly through the bridges, four Cotton-top Tamarins got close to us. We were excited and quickly took some pictures of them. And in front of us, there was an animal which looks like a big bird, it ran into the underbrush after we approached it.</P></div><div class="exp-part-two"><h2 class="exp-part-title">Children's Zoo</h2><img src=Taipei_Zoo23.jpg alt="no pic"><P>After visiting the whole Taipei Zoo, we took a break at Children s Zoo. I think this display area is suitable for parents to play with their children. There are many animals which children will like, such as Meerkat, Chinchilla, Alpaca, and so on. When I was sitting beside my friend and waiting other teams which had not finished their games, I saw some people chasing the chickens. Their playing scene made me keep laughing.</P></div></div><div class="tips-section"><div id="tips-sec-title"><h1>Tips for your trip in Taipei Zoo</h1></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Raised Tickets</p><p class="bullet">Lunch Time Jam</p></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Additional Costs</p><p class="bullet">Wear The Sneakers</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div id="footer-info-block"><div class="social-media"><a id="ig" href="https://www.instagram.com"><img src="../footer-icon/instagram.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="fb" href="https://zh-tw.facebook.com"><img src="../footer-icon/facebook.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="tw" href="https://twitter.com"><img src="../footer-icon/twitter.png" alt="no pic"></a></div><div id="contact-info"><p>Contact Info</p><div id="email"><p>E-mail: travellingblog@group14.com</p></div><div id="tel"><p>Tel: +886 12345678</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
