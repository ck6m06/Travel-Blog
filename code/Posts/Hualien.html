For example, there are two national parks in Hualien county, Taroko National Park and Yushan National Park. Furthermore, it has the culture of indigenous people, there are many tribes, including Atayal, Truku, Amis, Sediq, and so on. So you can have a lot of unforgettable travel experiences in Hualien.</p></div><div class="experience"><div class="exp-part-one"><h2 class="exp-part-title">Taroko National Park</h2><img src=hualien3-1.jpg alt="no pic"><P>When you come to Hualien, do not miss Taroko National Park. Through the work of nature, many impressive landscapes such as cliffs and canyons in Taroko National Park are created. This time, I went to Tianxiang in Taroko, and stayed there for one night. During the visit, I also went to the Buluowan Suspension Bridge (Mountain-Moon Bridge), Jiuqu Cave, Shakadang Trail, Baiyang Trail.I recommend that you must go to the Baiyang Trail during summer because of the seven tunnels in the trail. And you will feel the cool air when you walk into the tunnels, it is a wonderful experience in hot summer.Besides, the highlight is the Shuilian Cave at the end of the trail. The Shuilian Cave can bring you an exciting adventure. Walking in it will definitely make you soaked, and the spring water will pour out from the top of the cave. In addition, you can choose two routes, namely, water or land, in the cave. If you choose water, it will bring you more exciting challenges and a cooler experience.</P></div><div class="exp-part-two"><h2 class="exp-part-title">The Coastline</h2><img src=hualien5.jpg alt="no pic"><P>You can choose the coastline or ridgeline during the trip in Hualien. This time I chose the coastline, all the way along the Taiwan 11 line to the south, you can enjoy the scenery outside the car window is the vast Pacific Ocean. I spent a day from downtown Hualien to Shitiping, then from Shitiping to Guangfu Sugar Factory, and finally back to Taipei along the ridgeline. I went to scenic spots such as Jinshizizi Skywalk trail, Shitiping, and Shimen Cave on the coastline. I would like to introduce the Jinshizizi Skywalk trail in particular. You may think it is a very long trail, but, in fact, it will be completed within only ten to twenty minutes. It should be noted that the trail is narrow, and it is almost one-way when there are many crowds, so remember to stop and take pictures, or you will have to buy a new ticket to enter again. One feature of the trail is that it have a section of trail is glass flooring, but only one or two can be seen clearly. Although this trail is very short and the glass flooring does not seem to be very distinctive, the sea view of Hualien is still worth a visit, and it is recommended to go with other attractions on the coastline.</P></div></div><div class="tips-section"><div id="tips-sec-title"><h1>Tips for your trip in Hualien</h1></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Sun Protection</p><p class="bullet">Tarffic</p></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Clothing</p><p class="bullet">Monkey</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div id="footer-info-block"><div class="social-media"><a id="ig" href="https://www.instagram.com"><img src="../footer-icon/instagram.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="fb" href="https://zh-tw.facebook.com"><img src="../footer-icon/facebook.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="tw" href="https://twitter.com"><img src="../footer-icon/twitter.png" alt="no pic"></a></div><div id="contact-info"><p>Contact Info</p><div id="email"><p>E-mail: travellingblog@group14.com</p></div><div id="tel"><p>Tel: +886 12345678</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
