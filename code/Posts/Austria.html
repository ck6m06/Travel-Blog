As soon as we arrived at Graz Hauptbahnhof, which is the main station, we were impressed by the beautiful ceiling of the station as shown in the picture above. After arriving at the main station, we then consulted with the staff in the tourist information about whether to take the tram or other type of local transportation and which ticket best fit us to get to the hotel. In the end, we decided to purchase the 1-hour tickets instead of the 24-hour tickets and took the tram to the city center, Hauptplatz/Congress station. After quickly settling down, we went to the supermarket nearby , called Markt, to do some shopping. On the way back to the hotel, there was a nice small take-away shop, selling delicious pizza and tasty kebab. We end a wonderful first day of our trip with nice food, drink, and the most important part, the stunning scenery of Graz.</P></div><div class="exp-part-two"><h2 class="exp-part-title">Salzburg</h2><img src=Austria1.jpg alt="no pic"><P>In Salzburg, we bought a 24-hours ticket called Salzburg Card. I highly recommend anyone who would like to spend a whole day looking around or visiting different landmarks in Salzburg, to buy this ticket at the beginning of your trip. Starting from the visit of the house, Hagenauer Haus, where a famous and well-known musician, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was born. We've also visited a majestic palace, which is called Schloss Helbrunn and went to St. Peter's Church, called Peterskirche in german. The next stop is the Salzburg Residenz which is also a famous magnificent landmark in Salzburg. We really enjoyed our day of being able to enter so many spectacular places!</P></div></div><div class="tips-section"><div id="tips-sec-title"><h1>Tips for your trip in Austria</h1></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Have coins by your side</p><p class="bullet">Check the time schedule of the tram and the railway</p></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Look up the map first</p><p class="bullet">Go to the tourist information center</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div id="footer-info-block"><div class="social-media"><a id="ig" href="https://www.instagram.com"><img src="../footer-icon/instagram.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="fb" href="https://zh-tw.facebook.com"><img src="../footer-icon/facebook.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="tw" href="https://twitter.com"><img src="../footer-icon/twitter.png" alt="no pic"></a></div><div id="contact-info"><p>Contact Info</p><div id="email"><p>E-mail: travellingblog@group14.com</p></div><div id="tel"><p>Tel: +886 12345678</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
