Traveling with a group of friends from the same country, there was a lot of laughter along the way (the only thing left on the way up the hill was the sound of the car engine). When arriving at Alishan, there are mountains, rivers, and girls singing a song. I'm sure most of you have heard this song before. Before that, I always thought that the title of the song was "The Girls of Alishan", but the aborigines of the Tsou tribe told me that actually the name of this song is called "Mountain is Green".</p></div><div class="experience"><div class="exp-part-one"><h2 class="exp-part-title">YUYUPAS Alishan Tsou Cultural Tribe</h2><img src=alishan3.jpg alt="no pic"><P>We also came here to knew the Tsou culture, and the aborigines brought us wonderful performances, such as the Hunting Dance (Warrior Dance), the Millet Harvest Festival Dance (ceremonial dance to worship the goddess of millet), and the singer group "Maple Leaf" sang for us. At the same time, the aboriginals also distributed Tsou-style specialties for tourists to try and drink, such as millet wine, goat pork jerky, etc. What impresses me most is the enthusiasm of the Tsou aborigines. Although the tribe is located at an altitude of 1,300 meters and is surrounded by magnificent mountains and tea fields, their enthusiasm surrounds me like a hot summer in Kaohsiung.</P></div><div class="exp-part-two"><h2 class="exp-part-title">Alishan National Scenic Area</h2><img src=alishan1.jpg alt="no pic"><P>The senior that travel together had made wish at the Wishing Pond in the Alishan National Scenic Area last year, and the wish had come true, so he went back for votive (I heard that the Wishing Pond is very efficacious). When visiting, those were tall trees and pools. The most impressive is the "Sister Pool". It looks ordinary from a distance, and at most it gives people a feeling of peace and tranquility; when you get closer, you will find the pool Too many tadpoles! It's super much! It feels like they will turn into frogs? or toad? in the next second? (And its super big size). I remember that we have being here super long, maybe almost half an hour. Squatting around the edge of the pool to watch the tadpoles move? Anyway, it's very interesting, but I really don't know if a pool of tadpoles turns into frogs? or toad? what kind of scene would it be (scalp tingling thinking about it).</P></div></div><div class="tips-section"><div id="tips-sec-title"><h1>Tips for your trip in Alishan</h1></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Cold Weather</p><p class="bullet">Take Motion Sickness Pills</p></div><div class="tip-line"><p class="bullet">Careful Drive</p><p class="bullet">Buy Tickets Online</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div id="footer-info-block"><div class="social-media"><a id="ig" href="https://www.instagram.com"><img src="../footer-icon/instagram.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="fb" href="https://zh-tw.facebook.com"><img src="../footer-icon/facebook.png" alt="no pic"></a><a id="tw" href="https://twitter.com"><img src="../footer-icon/twitter.png" alt="no pic"></a></div><div id="contact-info"><p>Contact Info</p><div id="email"><p>E-mail: travellingblog@group14.com</p></div><div id="tel"><p>Tel: +886 12345678</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
