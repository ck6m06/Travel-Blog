In heralding a good day today.About 40km away, arrived at Fo Guang Shan. Through the introduction of Mr. Wu, I learned a lot of stories about Sakyamuni becoming a Buddha (and the 32 phases of Shiyin Bodhisattva, the meanings of some "Chinese characters and words", etc.). Every view and building of Fo Guang Shan is amazing (shutter click sound non-stop). The most impressive place should be the Jade Buddha Hall, which enshrines a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha and Buddha tooth relic, as well as Amitabha Buddha and Medicine Buddha. The size of the relic is very small, it is enshrined in a high place, it can only be seen with your "heart". Not in the hall can take pictures, but seeing as we came from afar, we were allowed to take a picture or two make souvenirs.

Master Cirong introduced the eight pagodas one by one: "One teaching" refers to humanistic Buddhism, the teaching of human needs, the teaching of goodness and beauty, and the teaching of Buddha; It is to do good deeds, say good words, and have good intentions; the "four giving" include giving people confidence, joy, hope, and convenience. Only by "giving" can there be "gain"; "five harmony" is the most basic It is family harmony, because "family and everything prosper"; "six perfections" are giving, keeping precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and prajna; "seven commandments" represent seven commandments songs; "eight ways" is the Eightfold Path, the eight methods of practice.</P></div><div class="exp-part-two"><h2 class="exp-part-title">Saving Angulimalya</h2><img src=Fo_Guang_Shan4.jpg alt="no pic"><P>Angulimalya, which means " finger necklace ", slaughtered people randomly. He did so because his evil teacher told him that killing a thousand people, and forming a necklace using a finger from each of his victims, would allow him to attain enlightenment. Having already killed 999 people, he intended to kill his mother 16 complete his task. When the Buddha heard about ins be felt compassion and went looking for Angulimalya with the aim of guiding him toward the right path. When Angullmalya saw the Buddha coming, he held up his knife with the intention of killing the Buddha but was unable to approach him, The Buddha then taught Angulimalya the Dharma, after which he repented his wrongdoings and took refuge in the Buddha, Angulimalya s transformation from being evil to being
kindhearted is similar to the sayings "Put down the butcher's knife and one instantly becomes a Buddha."
